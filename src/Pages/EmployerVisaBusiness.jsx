                To be eligible for Standard Business Sponsorship, an employer
                must have a good record of compliance with both Australian
                immigration and workplace laws, as well as being a financially
                stable business.

                  The Standard Business Sponsorship approval is valid for five
                  years and can be renewed if the employer wishes to continue
                  sponsoring workers. During this period, the employer is
                  obligated to fulfill certain responsibilities, such as
                  reporting to the Department of Home Affairs regarding the visa
                  holder’s employment and ensuring they receive appropriate
                  wages and working conditions.

                  It is important for businesses to consider the benefits and
                  obligations of becoming a Standard Business Sponsor before
                  making the decision to sponsor a worker. This includes the
                  positive impact it can have on their workforce and the ability
                  to access a global pool of skilled workers, as well as the
